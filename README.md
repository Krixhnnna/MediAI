# 🏥 Healthcare Chatbot

A university course project demonstrating the design and implementation of a basic healthcare-oriented conversational agent.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This chatbot simulates simple healthcare interactions using structured logic and controlled responses.  
The goal of the project is **educational**, focusing on chatbot workflow, architecture, and safety considerations rather than real medical functionality.

---

## ✨ Features

✔ Intent-based conversation handling  
✔ Rule-based / logic-driven responses  
✔ Basic healthcare query interaction  
✔ Context-aware conversation flow  
✔ Safety & disclaimer mechanisms

## 🧠 Architecture

The system follows a modular structure:

- **User Interface Layer** – Handles interaction
- **Intent Detection Module** – Identifies user requests
- **Logic Engine** – Applies rules & mappings
- **Response Generator** – Produces replies
- **Safety Layer** – Prevents unsafe guidance
